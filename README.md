A simple C program that simulates a user specified amount of Dice being Rolled for a specified amount of rolls. It prints out the distribution of the sums of the dicerolls.
it should be able to handle most invalid user inputs but it is not completely safe.

This program was made for my C programming Classes.




usage example:
how many Dice do you want? Max is 100 Dice
3 (user input)
How many rolls do you want? Max 50000
100 (user input)
